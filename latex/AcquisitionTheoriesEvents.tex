\section{Introduction}

\noindent Language is a powerful tool for moving thoughts from the
head of one person to another. Thus, any theory of language must make
contact with theories of thought and conceptual representation. Any
theory of language acquisition must explain how children link words to
concepts, whether those concepts were pre-existing or created during
the process of language acquisition. Conversely, theories of
conceptual representation are constrained by the need to support
language and language acquisition. Indeed, there is a rich tradition
of cognitive science research that explicitly tackles these issues \cite{Pinker1989,Clark2004,Bowerman1989}.

\noindent Right now is a particularly opportune time to assess our
current understanding of how language acquisition might be grounded in
thought -- particularly focusing beyond the better-explored domains of
objects and kinds to events. Recent years have seen the emergence of a
robust psychological literature and event representations \cite{Radvansky2014}. There has
likewise been explosive growth in work on concepts within the
``intuitive theory'' or ``Theory Theory'' framework
\cite{Gopnikinpress,Battaglia2013}. On such accounts, concepts are
embedded in robust theories -- much like the theories used by
scientists -- and derive their meaning from their role in those
theories. Importantly, our growing understanding of concepts
is not limited to mature representations: Work on infant and child
conceptual representations has been particularly productive \cite{Gopnikinpress,Ettinger,Henrik2015}.

\noindent Language research has similarly seen rapid progress. In this workshop,
we focus in particular on verbs. Linguists now have well-specified,
articulated theories of the semantics of verbs, which is necessarily
(part of) a theory of event representation \cite{Levin2011,Levin2005}. Importantly, there is now increasingly strong evidence for their psychological reality and role in language acquisition
\cite{Ambridge2013,HOSULS}. While these theories bear certain
similarities to the infant cognition work (e.g., representations of
agency, intentionality, and causation play a key role), in other ways
they diverge (e.g., they have no clear analog to an intuitive theory).

\noindent This workshop brings language acquisition researchers
together with experts in event cognition, intuitive theories, and
cognitive development in order to try to understand how the
developments in these disparate-yet-linked fields inform one
another. Because language must make contact with thought -- otherwise,
how do we communicate -- it is likely that the achievements of one
field will inform the others, and it must be the case that any
discrepancies between fields can be ultimately resolved. Given
thenecessarily interdisciplinary nature of this discussion, the Annual
Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society is an ideal venue for these conversations.

\section{Goals and Scope}

\section{Workshop Organization}

\noindent The workshop will be organized around a set of thirty-minute
presentations (including Q\&A). The presentations will range from
theoretical overviews to detailed discussion of specific
phenomena. Interspersed coffee breaks will help spur discussion about
promising avenues for future research and help build a common
vocabulary and agenda.

\subsection{Workshop Organizers}

\textbf{Eva Wittenberg} is \jtodo{Please blurb}. \textbf{Melissa Kline} is
\jtodo{please blurb}. \textbf{Joshua K. Hartshorne} is an assistant professor of
Psychology at Boston College. His work focuses on the interaction
between conceptual and linguistic representations in both processing
and acquisition \cite{HOSULS,HOT2015}.

\section{Target Audience}

\noindent The target audience for this workshop overlaps significantly
with the target audience of CogSci. The workshop's central themes
(language acquisition and conceptual representation) have long been
central concerns of the Society and are typically well-represented at
its meetings. Moreover, our specific focus on event representations
dovetails this year's overall conference theme: ``Recognizing and
representing events: Integrating psychological, linguistic,
computational and neural perspectives.''

\noindent Moreover, the workshop approaches these themes from a
multidisplinary perspective, as seen in the disciplinary diversity of
the participants. Because the presentations will be geared towards an
interdisciplinary audience, they should be approachable by a broad
cognitive science audience.
